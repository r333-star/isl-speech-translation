# Bridging Silence: Real-Time ISL-to-Speech AI Communicator

## Project Description
This project goes beyond simple translation—it gives ISL users a voice. Using computer vision and NLP, our system removes communication barriers in hospitals, schools, and government offices.

Built with open-source tools and designed for low-cost hardware, the solution accurately converts ISL hand gestures into natural speech and translates spoken words back into ISL visuals, enabling smooth, real-time, two-way communication.
